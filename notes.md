# Matrix Math

 - dot product - rows of first matrix, cols of second matrix. calc dot product (multiply each pair, then add them together). put the result in the row x col used to calc in resulting matrix.
 - requirement - number of cols in left = number of rows in right (inner dimensions are same)
 - resulting matrix - rows in right x cols in left (outer dimensions are result)
 - store records as rows, not columns
